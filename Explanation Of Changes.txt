Multiple Checkboxes:
I replaced the single bool? value with a Map<String, bool?> algorithms to manage multiple algorithm options. This demonstrates handling multiple checkbox states in Flutter.

Select All Checkbox:
Added a tristate "Select All" checkbox that can be checked, unchecked, or indeterminate (null). When toggled, it sets all individual checkboxes accordingly. This shows how to implement a master checkbox controlling others.

State Synchronization:
The updateSelectAll() method updates the "Select All" checkbox state based on the individual checkboxes, setting it to:

true if all are checked,
false if all are unchecked,
null (indeterminate) if mixed.
Display Selected Items:
Added a Text widget that dynamically shows which algorithms are currently selected. This provides immediate feedback to the user.

Comments:
Added comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each change and how it works.
